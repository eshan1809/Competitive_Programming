/*
You are given three integers a,b and c.

Find two positive integers x and y (x>0 & y>0) such that:

1.the decimal representation of x without leading zeroes consists of "a" digits;
2.the decimal representation of y without leading zeroes consists of "b" digits;
3.the decimal representation of gcd(x,y) without leading zeroes consists of c digits.
gcd(x,y) denotes the greatest common divisor (GCD) of integers x and y.

Output x and y.
