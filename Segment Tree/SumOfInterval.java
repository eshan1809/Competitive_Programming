/*
You are given an array(of integers) of length n.
You are required to answer q queries.

Queries can be of two types
0. 0 pos val : In this you have to update arr[pos] to val.
1. 1 l r: In this query u have to find the sum of all elements in this interval.

Sum of elements in interval [l, r] means sum of all arr[i] for which i is in range [l, r].

To do the above task u have to create a datastructure as follows :-

Implement the SegmentTree class:
1. SegmentTree(int arr[]): Initializes the SegmentTree object with an array,
2. void update(int pos, int val): updates the arr[pos] to val,
3. int query(int l, int r): return sum of all element's in interval [l, r].
